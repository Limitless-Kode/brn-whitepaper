access the Endless Ranger Awakening, you will come across a total of four distinct game modes along with several arenas. Our goal is to maximize your user experience while providing you with the opportunity to earn money through the GameFi ecosystem.</p><p><strong>1. Fight For BRN Arenas</strong></p><p><strong>2. BRN Arenas</strong></p><p><strong>3. Unique(Boss) Arenas</strong></p><p><strong>4. Event Arenas</strong> </p><p>Each mode has its own unique income models and difficulties. Completing strategic battles in each mode will reward you in USD directly, rather than through tokens like other projects. (You&#x27;ll get money in US dollars  for winning important battles in each mode. Other projects usually give tokens instead of cash.) This prevents the inflation of $BRN token and allows players to earn more money. Our advanced technology and systems ensure that our platform is secure and reliable.</p><p>We hope you enjoy exploring our game modes! Check out the detailed explanations of each mode in the following sections. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fight-for-brn-arena">Fight for BRN Arena<a href="#fight-for-brn-arena" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fight for BRN Arena" title="Direct link to Fight for BRN Arena">​</a></h2><p>To enter the arenas (1vs1-5vs5) and fight, first use the Connect Wallet system. Once inside, you&#x27;ll see a selection button with 10 different risk options,ranging from 10 BRN to 5000 BRN. (10 BRN, 50 BRN, 75 BRN, 100 BRN, 200 BRN, 500 BRN, 750 BRN, 1000 BRN, 2500 BRN, 5000 BRN) Choose the one that suits you best.  You can also battle a friend in a 1vs1 arena by inviting them through the &quot;friends&quot; section. Request that they add their own amount of BRN to the system according to your selected rate. If you prefer to match with a random player, select the amount of BRN you want to add to the pool and wait for an opponent to match with you. There is a 10-second preparation time before the battle starts. Additionally, entering the Fight For BRN arena gives you +5 points towards your BRN Rank, and the winning player receives an additional +10 BRN Rank. BRN Rank is reset every month, and the top 3 players receive USD and various rewards from us.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-vs-1">1 vs 1<a href="#1-vs-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1 vs 1" title="Direct link to 1 vs 1">​</a></h3><p>The battle lasts for 3 minutes.

When someone kills Robocrap, a message announcing their victory will appear for everyone to see.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>If a player dies against Robocrap, they will revive in the main arena, and any damage dealt to the boss will disappear.</p></div></div><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Reward</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><ul><li>Player who defeat Robocrap, has a +%25 chance to drop an Activity Token Box and gain quick access to privileges in the game. </li><li>Each player who joins Robocrap Arena gains 10 BOSS Rank points. </li></ul></div></div><p>The health and damage of the Robocrap Boss in our game:</p><p>Health: 10,000 </p><p>Damage: 150 to 300.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-arenas">Event Arenas<a href="#event-arenas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Event Arenas" title="Direct link to Event Arenas">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="polygon">Polygon<a href="#polygon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Polygon" title="Direct link to Polygon">​</a></h3><p>This mode, which is powered by Artificial Intelligence, helps users to improve their character skills and develop strategies for their character.

Each character has a counter character, meaning that X character might be strong against Y character but weak against Z character.

To enter the arena, simply access the War In Hell interface during the event and engage in the 10-second battle mode.

One of the most significant community battles is the Clan Battle, which takes place every Sunday at 6 PM UTC. Players can either create their own clan or join an existing one in the game. To participate in the Clan Battle, clan leaders must register with the Regar NPC in the Main Arena. Registration can be done daily until one hour before the battle starts. The system randomly matches clans, with each clan fighting only one opponent. For example, Clan A will only face Clan B or Clan C, but not both. Only 20 members from each clan can participate in the battle, and no extra players are allowed to join after the first 20. If a player loses connection during the game, they can continue from where they left off as long as the event time has not expired. Once players enter the arena, they wait for one minute before the battle begins. The battle lasts for 30 minutes, and the clan with the most points at the end wins. Each player&#x27;s killing earns +1 point for their clan, and players can track their progress on the kill counter on the right side of the screen.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Reward</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Winning clan members will receive 1 NFT Ticket BOX each, and entering the Clan Battle Arena gives players +100 activity points.</p></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rise-and-slay">Rise and Slay<a href="#rise-and-slay" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rise and Slay" title="Direct link to Rise and Slay">​</a></h3><p>Our game mode is designed for maximum individual enjoyment and personal achievement.

To register for this event, players must sign up with the REGAR NPC. Teams consist of 5 players, and matches are played between two teams. The arena is equipped with Artificial Intelligence support and players are randomly assigned to teams based on the application rate. Before the event starts, no player can predict which team they will be on. Once the event begins, players are placed on either team A or B. The satellite is located at an equal distance from both teams in the center of the field. To acquire the satellite, a player clicks on it and waits for 5 seconds. After obtaining the satellite, the player must take it to their own area, click on the satellite addition area in their own area, and wait for another 5 seconds to place the satellite in their own area. Opposing players will fight to take control of the satellite. If a player decides to play for time instead of taking the satellite to their own area after obtaining it from the middle area, the satellite will automatically fall from the opponent&#x27;s head every 30 seconds, and the opposing player can pick it up. The player who drops the satellite or the opposing player can take control of it again by standing on the fallen satellite for 5 seconds. When time runs out, the team that successfully places the satellite in their own satellite base wins the event. It is important to note that the satellite must be placed in the satellite placement area for it to count.
