# BRN Metaverse at GameFi

In BRN Metaverse GameFi ecosystem, there are several key elements and interactions: 

- We provide **Non-fungible Tokens** (NFTs) such as in-game inventories (weapons & protectors), pets, and alchemy stones that provide unique abilities to characters, which can be earned, used in in-game activities, or bought and sold on our NFT Marketplace.
- **Virtual Economies:** BRN Metaverse GameFi ecosystem creates virtual economies where the value of in-game assets is determined by player demand, rarity, and utility. These assets can have real-world value outside the game.
- **Play to earn:** Players can earn cryptocurrencies, dollars or other valuable tokens (NFTs) by participating in in-game arenas, completing tasks, reaching goals, or contributing to the ecosystem through the "play-to-earn" concept.
