# BRN Metaverse at Artificial Intelligence


## Non-player Characters
Our game features AI-driven NPCs that interact with users in a realistic and dynamic manner, each with their own personalities, goals, and unique responses to user actions. This makes the virtual world feel more alive and immersive.

There are a total of 5 NPCs in the main area of our game, all coded with artificial intelligence technology by our programmers. These NPCs provide users with the opportunity to fulfill their requests without the need for a third party.

The Actiswap NPC allows you to purchase in-game inventories using Activity Tokens, the currency used in the game.

The Regar NPC allows you to register for arenas that require registration, such as Clan Battle and Space Station.

The Flywheel NPC allows you to participate in the "Spin & Win" event and win various rewards.

The Mission Helper NPC reminds you of tasks created in the game to ensure sustainability and awards you for completed tasks.

The Robotic NPC allows you to convert the ERA Tickets you earned in the game into real items, which can then be used or sold in the game's marketplace.


## Polygon

Our Polygon Arena features an artificial intelligence system that lets users select the difficulty level of their opponents. This means that you can challenge our game characters that adapt to players' experiences and strategies.


## Uniques 

Our Boss characters are located in arenas and are designed with artificial intelligence to detect players' gaming experiences and strategies. This enables them to provide appropriate defense against your attacks.



**BRN Metaverse is set to achieve a major milestone in the realm of artificial intelligence for the game's future development. This breakthrough will take users' war and Metaverse experiences to the next level by incorporating wearable technology.**
