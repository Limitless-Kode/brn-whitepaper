# BRN Metaverse at GameNFT

Our NFTs are digital assets that are created using blockchain technology and are unique. NFTs have become an important and unique way to participate in games and in-game economies. Our GameNFTs represent digital assets such as protector or weapon NFTs for characters used in the game, special items such as alchemy stones or pets. Our game developers tokenize in-game assets as NFTs, allowing players to own the items they have in the game in the real world and trade them on our NFT Marketplace. This adds a new dimension to in-game economies and offers players the opportunity to earn extra income in the real world. These NFTs are produced in limited numbers and allow characters to gain extra power and special abilities.

Initially, BRN Metaverse offers three unique NFT Collections:

- Tier 1
- Tier 2
- Tier 3.

While each part of these NFT sets will give you power, combining them all can give you extra powers. 

We offer our NFTs in a way that you can obtain them through our win model as you play the game, instead of just selling them for money. You can obtain NFT boxes by killing unique monsters in certain game areas, depending on your luck. From these boxes, you can obtain tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, or a special NFT piece  for those monsters according to their chance percentage. If these items are suitable for your character, you can wear them. If not, you can earn income by selling these NFTs on our NFT Marketplace.
