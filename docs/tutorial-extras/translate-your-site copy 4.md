# Battle and System Mechanics

In the BRN Metaverse universe, each character has unique features. When choosing a character, it's important for players to consider if it fits their own combat dynamics. For example, players who want to be at the forefront in battles tend to choose the Tank character, while players who want to inflict the most damage from the back of the battle generally prefer Marksman characters. This integrates with each player's own strategy.

It's important to note that characters in the game have power balances compared to others, meaning they may be strong against one character while weak against another. Players can identify their character's weak points by testing them in the Polygon Arena. From there, they can develop strategies to cover their weaknesses and gain the upper hand.

It's worth keeping in mind that the BRN Metaverse universe operates on a play-to-earn system, not a pay-to-win system. This means that even if you're up against a more powerful character, you can still defeat them with the right strategy.

## Combat Dynamics

In the Endless Ranger Awakening, there are a total of 12 characters and 6 roles. Here are the descriptions of the characters and roles:

**Warrior:** "Barton and Harley" - These characters are experts in balanced combat. They can deal sudden damage while also being effective in defense. They have special skills that can cause sudden high damage. Additionally, each character's passive skills can significantly affect the character's power balance.

**Mage:** "Metawatt and Witch" - These characters specialize in dealing instant intense damage. Their defenses and health are lower, but their magic powers are greater. Having a mage in your team during combat can significantly increase your chances of winning.

**Assassin:** "Ninja and Router" - These characters have balanced defense and health, but have high attack speed and power. They can move faster than their opponents and deal sudden high damage. These characters are important choices for catching and escaping enemies during combat.

**Tank:** "Axer and Barbarossa" - These characters have high defense and health, but balanced attack speed and power. These characters are highly preferred in both individual and group battles and are often on the front lines. They take less damage compared to their opponents and can deal sudden intense damage. Having the right number of Tanks in your team during group battles can significantly increase your success rate.

**Support:** "Angel and Reef" - These characters have high defense and health, but balanced attack speed and power. They are highly preferred in both individual and group battles and have special abilities to save their teammates' lives. They can provide life-saving assistance to their teammates by restoring health and providing shields to reduce damage. Having a Support role in your team during group battles is crucial for success.

**Marksman:** "Elf and Metabot" - These characters have balanced defense and health, but high attack power. They can deal intense damage with their skills and have the ability to attack from a distance compared to other characters. They deal a lot of damage in combat and play an important role in winning battles.

:::tip
The key to victory in individual and group combat is to create a well-structured team. Going into battle with players who have the same roles can decrease your chances of success.

When choosing characters, it is important to know their BASIC Stat ratios. Knowing how much defense, attack power, or attack speed each character has will affect your character selection.

## PvP and PvE Systems

In order to keep the game dynamic and promote competition, the game utilizes both PvP and PvE systems.

### PvP System

The primary gameplay mechanism in Fight for BRN, BRN Arena, and all Event Arenas is PvP, which pits players against each other instead of computer-controlled bots

### PvE System

In contrast, the main gameplay mechanism in Polygon Arena and all BOSS Arenas is PvE, where players battle against computer-controlled opponents. In Polygon Arena, players fight against AI-supported bots to test their characters and improve their strategies, while in BOSS Arenas, they battle against monsters provided by the game.
