# Getting Started (Beginner's Guide)

Endless Ranger Awakening offers three ways to enter the game. The first is to register and log in using a username and password with WEB1 technology. The second is to log in with your Gmail account, which was introduced with WEB2 technology. The third and most recent method is to log in using the Connect Wallet system, made possible by WEB3 technology, by connecting your  wallet. To participate in paid battles in BRN Arenas and receive rewards in USDT rankings, you must log in using the Connect Wallet system. Note that to log in to the game using these methods, you will need a  wallet. Our game supports all types of  wallets, so you can create any  wallet and enter the game in a decentralized way by selecting the Binance Smart Chain network from your wallet at any time.

Once you log in, you'll be directed to the character selection screen, where you can choose from 12 different characters. Each character has 5 interchangeable inventories, which are sold as NFTs. Each NFT provides different powers that give you an edge over your competitors and increase your chances of winning battles. You can also strengthen the NFTs you use with our alchemy system, giving you an even greater advantage over opponents with the same NFT. 

Our game is designed to allow you to develop your skills and create additional sources of income. You can complete daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, compete in arenas, socialize in the main area, and enjoy the Metaverse as you see fit.
