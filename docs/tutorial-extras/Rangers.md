## Character Development and Customization

The primary method of character development in our game is customization through Items. Each character is equipped with 5 inventories, categorized into three levels: Elite, Special, and Rare. The basic versions of these inventories are readily available at the start of the game. However, you have the option to enhance each Inventory by acquiring more powerful versions from the BRN Metaverse website or in-game Market in ERA. Each Item you acquire for your character provides unique benefits that can give you an advantage. Moreover, if you manage to acquire and utilize all 5 Items for your character, you will unlock additional abilities. In essence, to surpass your opponents in the BRN Metaverse game, it is crucial to strengthen your character with Items. These Items can be obtained by purchasing them from the Marketplace or by engaging in battles within the game. The sets of Items available for characters are as follows:

+ **Angel**: Wing, Armor, Boots, Necklace and Aura

+ **Axer**: Axe, Arm, Pants, Shoulder Pads and Tattoo

+ **Barbarossa**: Anchor, Hook, Hat, Jacket and Leg

+ **Barton**: Sword, Armor, Necklace, Eye Patch and Bracelet

### Alchemy System & Item 

Every item you purchase for your character in our game comes with a +0 bonus. While using an item from the basic inventory will provide you with more power, it's up to you to enhance this power further. Our game offers an alchemy system that allows you to increase the value and power of the item you purchased. You can upgrade your inventory from +0 to +3 using the alchemy system. To perform the alchemy process, you will need two additional inventories: Alchemy Stone and Alchemy Powder. Without these inventories, you won't be able to add a + to your item. The Alchemy Stone can be purchased from the store using Event Tokens or the in-game currency, ERA. Alchemy Powder, on the other hand, can only be obtained in the game using Activity Tokens. It's important to note that even if you have both inventories, there's still a chance that the addition of + might fail. In such cases, your item will not be lost but will simply return to its original +0 state. The success rates for alchemy are as follows:

+ +1 Success Rate = 20%

+ +2 Success Rate = 8%

+ +3 Success Rate = 3%

The bonuses you get from using alchemy on your ıtems are as follows:

:::info Weapon

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="➕1" label="➕1">+6 Attack power</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="➕2" label="➕2">+10 Attack power</TabItem> 
  <TabItem value="➕3" label="➕3">+16 Attack power</TabItem>
</Tabs>

::: 
:::info Protector

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="➕1" label="➕1">+3 Defense and +30 HP</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="➕2" label="➕2">+5 Defense and +30 HP</TabItem> 
  <TabItem value="➕3" label="➕3">+8 Defense and +30 HP</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::  

If alchemy fails, the Items reverts back to +0. There is no risk of losing the Items.
