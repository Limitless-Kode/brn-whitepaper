# Security and Anti-Cheat Measures

Security and anti-cheat measures are at the forefront of our priorities. We take the utmost care to ensure that all user account data is stored on a highly secure database and all transactions are handled on the blockchain by a smart contract. We understand the importance of security and take all the necessary steps to ensure that our users' information is kept safe and secure.
To achieve this level of security, we do not store any important information locally on the client devices. This makes it virtually impossible for hackers to gain access to your information. You can rest assured that your data is safe with us.
In addition to these measures, we regularly review and update our security protocols to ensure that we are always ahead of potential threats. Our team of experts is constantly monitoring the system for any suspicious activity and taking steps to prevent any breaches.
We believe that trust is key to building a strong community, and we will continue to work hard to earn and maintain the trust of our users.
