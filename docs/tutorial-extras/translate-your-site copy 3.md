# Playgrounds and Game Modes

Once you access the Endless Ranger Awakening, you will come across a total of four distinct game modes along with several arenas. Our goal is to maximize your user experience while providing you with the opportunity to earn money through the GameFi ecosystem.

**1. Fight For BRN Arenas**

**2. BRN Arenas**

**3. Unique(Boss) Arenas**

**4. Event Arenas** 

Each mode has its own unique income models and difficulties. Completing strategic battles in each mode will reward you in USD directly, rather than through tokens like other projects. (You'll get money in US dollars  for winning important battles in each mode. Other projects usually give tokens instead of cash.) This prevents the inflation of $BRN token and allows players to earn more money. Our advanced technology and systems ensure that our platform is secure and reliable.

We hope you enjoy exploring our game modes! Check out the detailed explanations of each mode in the following sections. 

## Fight for BRN Arena 

To enter the arenas (1vs1-5vs5) and fight, first use the Connect Wallet system. Once inside, you'll see a selection button with 10 different risk options,ranging from 10 BRN to 5000 BRN.

You can also battle a friend in a 1vs1 arena by inviting them through the "friends" section. Request that they add their own amount of BRN to the system according to your selected rate. If you prefer to match with a random player, select the amount of BRN you want to add to the pool and wait for an opponent to match with you. There is a 10-second preparation time before the battle starts. Additionally, entering the Fight For BRN arena gives you +5 points towards your BRN Rank, and the winning player receives an additional +10 BRN Rank. BRN Rank is reset every month, and the top 3 players receive USD and various rewards from us.

Our modes are designed to optimize user experience and enhance enjoyment. In BOSS arena modes, competition is at its peak, with all players vying for supremacy over time.

The game features 12 characters, and to get started, you must select your opponent through Polygon Arena and then choose from 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

### Clan Battle

In Endless Ranger Awakening, players can participate in both individual and community battles. One of the most significant community battles is the Clan Battle, which takes place every Sunday at 6 PM UTC. Players can either create their own clan or join an existing one in the game. To participate in the Clan Battle, clan leaders must register with the Regar NPC in the Main Arena. Registration can be done daily until one hour before the battle starts. The system randomly matches clans, with each clan fighting only one opponent. For example, Clan A will only face Clan B or Clan C, but not both. Only 20 members from each clan can participate in the battle, and no extra players are allowed to join after the first 20. If a player loses connection during the game, they can continue from where they left off as long as the event time has not expired. Once players enter the arena, they wait for one minute before the battle begins. The battle lasts for 30 minutes, and the clan with the most points at the end wins. Each player's killing earns +1 point for their clan, and players can track their progress on the kill counter on the right side of the screen.

:::tip Reward

Winning clan members will receive 1 NFT Ticket BOX each, and entering the Clan Battle Arena gives players +100 activity points.

:::

### Rise and Slay

Our game mode is designed for maximum individual enjoyment and personal achievement. We do not encourage community battles, as we value the unique abilities and interests of each player in our arena. The game mode is available at four different times throughout the day:

- 8:30 AM UTC
- 12:30 PM UTC
- 4:30 PM UTC
- 8:30 PM UTC

Please note that the battle mode is closed for the first 10 seconds after the event starts, during which time players should prepare for battle. The event lasts for 10 minutes and is designed to reward the top 3 players who have killed the most opponents during this time. Each player will receive 1 point for each kill, and dead players will respawn immediately without any wait time. However, players must wait 5 seconds before re-entering the battle. Kill counter will allow you to track how many players each character has killed. At the end of the event, the top 3 players with the most points earned through character kills will receive the following rewards.

::::tip Reward

- Please do not confuse the activity rank with the kill counter in the arena, which only records the number of kills for the first place player in that particular arena.

:::

::::

### Space Station

In ERA, players not only participate in individual battles and challenges, but also in community battles. To register for this event, players must sign up with the REGAR NPC. Teams consist of 5 players, and matches are played between two teams. The arena is equipped with Artificial Intelligence support and players are randomly assigned to teams based on the application rate. Before the event starts, no player can predict which team they will be on. Once the event begins, players are placed on either team A or B. The satellite is located at an equal distance from both teams in the center of the field. To acquire the satellite, a player clicks on it and waits for 5 seconds. After obtaining the satellite, the player must take it to their own area, click on the satellite addition area in their own area, and wait for another 5 seconds to place the satellite in their own area. Opposing players will fight to take control of the satellite. If a player decides to play for time instead of taking the satellite to their own area after obtaining it from the middle area, the satellite will automatically fall from the opponent's head every 30 seconds, and the opposing player can pick it up. The player who drops the satellite or the opposing player can take control of it again by standing on the fallen satellite for 5 seconds. When time runs out, the team that successfully places the satellite in their own satellite base wins the event. It is important to note that the satellite must be placed in the satellite placement area for it to count. If there is no satellite in any area, the event ends in a draw.

:::tip Reward
- Players will receive +10 activity rank points upon entry and +1 activity rank point for each kill.
- Winning teams will receive 25 Activity Tokens
- Losing teams will receive 5 Activity Tokens
- If there is a tie, both teams will receive 5 activity tokens.

:::

### Eternal Warrior

This game mode focuses on the creation of the most powerful character. The objective is to survive until the end, and players achieve this by being the last character standing in the arena. Killing opponents sends them back to the main arena, but the goal isn't to rack up the most kills, it's to outlast the competition. To do so, players will need to develop their own unique strategies. The arena opens five times a day at the following hours:

- 5 AM UTC
- 8 AM UTC
- 11 AM UTC
- 2 PM UTC
- 5 PM UTC

For the first 10 seconds after the event starts, combat mode is disabled to give players time to prepare. Once the battle begins, the player who dies is sent back to the city and is out of the competition. To see who has the most kills, check the kill counter on the right side of the screen. The player who emerges as the last one standing in the arena wins the battle and receives the rewards.

:::tip Reward

+ 25 Activity Tokens for the last warrior
