# Playgrounds and Game Modes

Once you access the Endless Ranger Awakening, you will come across a total of four distinct game modes along with several arenas. Our goal is to maximize your user experience while providing you with the opportunity to earn money through the GameFi ecosystem.

**1. Fight For BRN Arenas**

**2. ERA Arena**

**3. Unique(Boss) Arenas**

**4. Event Arenas** 

Each mode has its own unique income models and difficulties. Completing strategic battles in each mode will reward you in USD directly, rather than through tokens like other projects. (You'll get money in US dollars  for winning important battles in each mode. Other projects usually give tokens instead of cash.) This prevents the inflation of $BRN token and allows players to earn more money. Our advanced technology and systems ensure that our platform is secure and reliable.

We hope you enjoy exploring our game modes! Check out the detailed explanations of each mode in the following sections. 

## Fight for BRN Arena 

To enter the arenas (1vs1-5vs5) and fight, first use the Connect Wallet system. Once inside, you'll see a selection button with 10 different risk options,ranging from 10 BRN to 5000 BRN. (10 BRN, 50 BRN, 75 BRN, 100 BRN, 200 BRN, 500 BRN, 750 BRN, 1000 BRN, 2500 BRN, 5000 BRN) Choose the one that suits you best.  You can also battle a friend in a 1vs1 arena by inviting them through the "friends" section. Request that they add their own amount of BRN to the system according to your selected rate. If you prefer to match with a random player, select the amount of BRN you want to add to the pool and wait for an opponent to match with you. There is a 10-second preparation time before the battle starts.

Additionally, when you emerge victorious in this arena, you will be rewarded with BRN in proportion to the amount you risked. Furthermore, your ranking will ascend in the Ranking System. Each victory will propel you to a higher rank, and at the conclusion of the month, you will also receive a USDT reward as part of our rank reset.

(An explanation of the Rank System will be provided at the end of the page).

### 1 vs 1 
The battle lasts for 3 minutes. Ief a player loses their internet connection during the fight, they have 30 seconds to reconnect. If they fail to do so, they automatically lose the battle. For each opponent you kill, you earn +2 points. The player with the most points at the end of the 3 minutes wins. After winning, 95% of the BRN Tokens in the common pool are automatically sent to the player. The remaining 5% are kept by the game team for development and rewards.

### 2 vs 2
The battle lasts for 4 minutes, and every player you eliminate earns your team +2 points. The number of opponents each player has killed can be seen from the Kill counter, which can be opened and closed on the right side of the arena. You have the option to open or close the counter at any time during the fight to avoid distractions. The team with the most points when the time runs out will win the battle. The remaining amounts in the pool will be distributed equally among the winning teams. 5% of these amounts will be sent to the developer wallet for game development and events within the game every month.

In this game arena, players can always enter without any cost and earn Rank points. These points can be used to obtain activity tokens and USDT. In this mode, battles are limited to teams of 5 players. You have the option to either form a team in advance or enter matchmaking as a solo player and get paired with random teams at any time of the day.

By participating in matches, you will accumulate Rank points, which are reset every month. (Please refer to the "ranks and rewards" section for more details on the Rank system.) Additionally, the arenas in this mode will undergo regular changes and new arenas will be introduced.

## Unique(Boss) Arenas

Our modes are designed to optimize user experience and enhance enjoyment. In Unique(Boss) arena modes, competition is at its peak, with all players vying for supremacy over time. Defeating these Bosses not only rewards you with prizes, but also enables you to advance in Unique(Boss) Rank. If you manage to secure a spot in the top 3 of the BOSS Rank, which resets monthly, you will receive USD and various rewards. Each Boss has its own arena, and players must locate and fight them. Some Bosses are incredibly powerful, so be cautious as your character may perish in the attempt to defeat them. With 6 unique characters in our game, each possessing distinct abilities and powers, certain strategies may prove more effective in different modes. Your character selection and Ä±tems will set you apart from the rest. Without further ado, let us introduce the Bosses of our Unique(Boss) Arenas in greater detail.

### Wild

Whenever a player enters the Wild Arena, they receive a +50 activity rank that's reset every month. The top 3 players with the highest activity rank receive rewards. The battle against Wild continues until he's defeated, and the player who takes him down receives a 1 Era Ticket and 1 Activity Token BOX.

## Event Arenas

### Polygon

This mode, which is powered by Artificial Intelligence, helps users to improve their character skills and develop strategies for their character. The game features 12 characters, and to get started, you must select your opponent through Polygon Arena and then choose from 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each character has a counter character, meaning that X character might be strong against Y character but weak against Z character. By identifying your weaknesses, you can work to eliminate them in battles. We recommend that you test your character one last time in our arena before entering any major battles. The arena is always open, with no time limit or reward for participating

### War in Hell

Our game mode featuring Demon Boss aims to provide an engaging and competitive user experience. Players can immerse themselves in the hellish themes of our universe and must quickly devise their own strategies to succeed. As Demon awaits challengers in the arena, players must also contend with others who seek to hunt down Demon. To enter the arena, simply access the War In Hell interface during the event and engage in the 10-second battle mode. Once inside, you have two options: attack Demon directly or take on other players attacking Demon. The event lasts for 20 minutes, and if Demon is defeated during this time, the top 3 players in the kill counter ranking will receive rewards. However, if Demon survives the entire event, only the top 3 players in the kill counter ranking will receive rewards. Our players can choose to be either Demon hunters or hunters who want to take down Demon in the event.

### Clan Battle

In Endless Ranger Awakening, players can participate in both individual and community battles. One of the most significant community battles is the Clan Battle, which takes place every Sunday at 6 PM UTC. Players can either create their own clan or join an existing one in the game. To participate in the Clan Battle, clan leaders must register with the Regar NPC in the Main Arena. Registration can be done daily until one hour before the battle starts. The system randomly matches clans, with each clan fighting only one opponent. For example, Clan A will only face Clan B or Clan C, but not both. Only 20 members from each clan can participate in the battle, and no extra players are allowed to join after the first 20. If a player loses connection during the game, they can continue from where they left off as long as the event time has not expired. Once players enter the arena, they wait for one minute before the battle begins. The battle lasts for 30 minutes, and the clan with the most points at the end wins. Each player's killing earns +1 point for their clan, and players can track their progress on the kill counter on the right side of the screen.

:::tip Reward

Winning clan members will receive 1 ERA Ticket + 1 Activity Token Box each, and entering the Clan Battle Arena gives players +100 activity points + 1 Activity Token.

:::

### Rise and Slay

Our game mode is designed for maximum individual enjoyment and personal achievement. We do not encourage community battles, as we value the unique abilities and interests of each player in our arena. The game mode is available at four different times throughout the day:

- 8:30 AM UTC
- 12:30 PM UTC
- 4:30 PM UTC
- 8:30 PM UTC

Please note that the battle mode is closed for the first 10 seconds after the event starts, during which time players should prepare for battle. The event lasts for 10 minutes and is designed to reward the top 3 players who have killed the most opponents during this time. Each player will receive 1 point for each kill, and dead players will respawn immediately without any wait time. However, players must wait 5 seconds before re-entering the battle. Kill counter will allow you to track how many players each character has killed. At the end of the event, the top 3 players with the most points earned through character kills will receive the following rewards.

::::tip Reward

* 2nd 30 Activity Tokens

* 3rd 30 Activity Tokens

- Please do not confuse the activity rank with the kill counter in the arena, which only records the number of kills for the first place player in that particular arena.

:::

::::

### Space Station

In ERA, players not only participate in individual battles and challenges, but also in community battles. To register for this event, players must sign up with the REGAR NPC. Teams consist of 5 players, and matches are played between two teams. The arena is equipped with Artificial Intelligence support and players are randomly assigned to teams based on the application rate. Before the event starts, no player can predict which team they will be on. Once the event begins, players are placed on either team A or B. The satellite is located at an equal distance from both teams in the center of the field. To acquire the satellite, a player clicks on it and waits for 5 seconds. After obtaining the satellite, the player must take it to their own area, click on the satellite addition area in their own area, and wait for another 5 seconds to place the satellite in their own area. Opposing players will fight to take control of the satellite. If a player decides to play for time instead of taking the satellite to their own area after obtaining it from the middle area, the satellite will automatically fall from the opponent's head every 30 seconds, and the opposing player can pick it up. The player who drops the satellite or the opposing player can take control of it again by standing on the fallen satellite for 5 seconds. When time runs out, the team that successfully places the satellite in their own satellite base wins the event. It is important to note that the satellite must be placed in the satellite placement area for it to count. If there is no satellite in any area, the event ends in a draw.

:::tip Reward
- Players will receive +10 activity rank points +1 activity token upon entry and +1 activity token for each kill. (Player can receive a maximum of 2 kill rewards for each player.)
- Winning teams will receive 25 Activity Tokens
- Losing teams will receive 5 Activity Tokens
- If there is a tie, both teams will receive 5 activity tokens.

:::

### Eternal Warrior

This game mode focuses on the creation of the most powerful character. The objective is to survive until the end, and players achieve this by being the last character standing in the arena. Killing opponents sends them back to the main arena, but the goal isn't to rack up the most kills, it's to outlast the competition. To do so, players will need to develop their own unique strategies. The arena opens five times a day at the following hours:

- 5 AM UTC
- 8 AM UTC
- 11 AM UTC
- 2 PM UTC
- 5 PM UTC

For the first 10 seconds after the event starts, combat mode is disabled to give players time to prepare. Once the battle begins, the player who dies is sent back to the city and is out of the competition. To see who has the most kills, check the kill counter on the right side of the screen. The player who emerges as the last one standing in the arena wins the battle and receives the rewards.

:::tip Reward

+ 25 Activity Tokens for the last warrior
+ 2 Activity Tokens for each warrior who takes a killed
+ +8 Activity Rank Points for entering 
+ +1 activity rank point for each character killed.

## Ranks & Rewards

### Ranking System
By entering the BRN Arena and ERA Arena in our game, you can increase your Rank . In our game, there are a total of 7 ranks: Unranked, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Endless. Players start as Unranked when they enter the game. In order to progress in ranked matches, they need a total of 100 points. Ranks are divided into 3 divisions among themselves. For example, Bronze 1, Bronze 2, Bronze 3, Silver 1, Silver 2, Silver 3, and so on until Diamond 1, Diamond 2, Diamond 3, and Endless (Final rank). Bronze 3 is a higher rank than Bronze 1, which means a player who is Silver 3 is at a higher level than a player who is Silver 1.
Endless is the final rank, and once a player reaches this rank, their goal will be to remain at the top of the Ranked Leaderboard by only accumulating points.

NOTE: The ranked leaderboard will be reset at the beginning of each month.
