## Character Development and Customization

The most important way to develop your characters in our game is to customize them with NFTs. Basically, each character has 5 interchangeable inventories, and these inventories have three levels: T1, T2, and T3. The basic versions of these inventories will already be available to you when you start the game. You can access each NFT that will provide you with extra power instead of these basic inventories from BRN Metaverse's NFT Marketplace. Each NFT you buy for your character has different features that will benefit you. Additionally, if you buy and use all 5 NFTs for your character, you will gain extra features. In summary, the most important way to be superior to your opponents in BRN Metaverse game is to strengthen your character with NFTs. You can obtain these NFTs by buying them from the Marketplace or by battling within the game. The NFT sets for characters are as follows:

+ **Angel**: Wing, Armor, Boots, Necklace and Aura

+ **Axer**: Axe, Arm, Pants, Shoulder Pads and Tattoo

+ **Barbarossa**: Anchor, Hook, Hat, Jacket and Leg

+ **Barton**: Sword, Armor, Necklace, Eye Patch and Bracelet

### Alchemy System & NFT 

In our game, each NFT you acquire for your character comes with a +0 bonus. While using an NFT from the basic inventory will give you more power, the ability to increase that power even further is in your hands. With the alchemy system in our game, you can make the NFT you purchased more valuable and powerful. With the alchemy system, you can increase your inventory from +0 to +3. You will need two additional inventories for the alchemy process: Alchemy Stone and Alchemy Dust. If you don't have even one of these two inventories, you can't add a + to your NFT. You can buy Alchemy Stone with either Activity Tokens, the in-game currency, or with BRN Tokens from the NFT Marketplace. You can only buy Alchemy Dust with Activity Tokens in the game. Of course, even if you have both inventories, there is still a chance that you won't be able to add a +. If the alchemy process fails, your NFT will not be lost, only returned to its original state of +0. The alchemy success rates are as follows:

+ +1 Success Rate = 20%

+ +2 Success Rate = 8%

+ +3 Success Rate = 3%

The bonuses you get from using alchemy on your NFT are as follows:

>**NFT Weapon +1 Bonus** = +10 Physical Damage or +10 Magic Damage (depending on the character's use of physical or magic damage)

>**NFT Weapon +2 Bonus** = +25 Physical Damage or +25 Magic Damage (depending on the character's use of physical or magic damage)

>**NFT Weapon +3 Bonus** = +45 Physical Damage or +45 Magic Damage (depending on the character's use of physical or magic damage)

>**NFT Protector +1 Bonus** = +10 Armor, +10 Magic Resistance, and +50 HP

>**NFT Protector +2 Bonus** = +25 Armor, +25 Magic Resistance, and +100 HP

>**NFT Protector +3 Bonus** = +40 Armor, +40 Magic Resistance, and +150 HP
