# Overview of Technical Details and Requirements



## System Requirements

The system requirements for running the software are as follows. If you are using a PC, you must have at least a Core i3 processor and an integrated graphics card. However, if you are using a mobile device, such as an iPhone or an iPad, the device must feature an Apple A12 Bionic processor. If you are using an Android device, the device must feature a Snapdragon 55 processor or above. It is important to ensure that your device meets these minimum requirements, as failure to meet them may result in the software not running smoothly or not running at all.

## Supported Platforms

Our product is currently supported on two platforms: PC and mobile. In the future, we are considering expanding to include VR capabilities, which would allow users to experience our product in a whole new way. With VR technology, users would be able to fully immerse themselves in our product and interact with it in a more intuitive and natural way. This would create an even more engaging experience that would keep our users coming back for more. In addition to expanding to new platforms, we are constantly working on improving the overall performance and user experience of our product. Our team of developers is dedicated to ensuring that our product is always up-to-date with the latest technology and trends, so that our users can enjoy the best possible experience.
