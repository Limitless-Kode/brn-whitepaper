The income model is designed to ensure that the rewards earned do not negatively impact the price of BRN in any way. In contrast, if you had earned uncompensated BRN in a different system, those rewards would lose value over time. The BRN Metaverse team has taken steps to prevent this from happening and has ensured that the project is not harmed by inflation or deflation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site copy 9":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site copy 9","title":"Getting Started (Beginner\'s Guide)","description":"Endless Ranger Awakening offers three ways to enter the game.
